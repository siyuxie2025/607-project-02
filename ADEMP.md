In this project, I conduct the simulation study based on a previous research project on quantile contextual bandit algorithm. 

The data generating processes are:
1. contextual vector $X_t$ :
2. linear coefficient $\beta$ : 
3. observational error $\epsilon_t$ : 

Estimands:
1. $\beta$ in each step
2. the cumulative regret $\sum_{t=1}^T R_t$

Methods: 
Here, I compare the quantile appraoch with ordinary least square approach mentioned in the supplementary material of \cite{Bastani, Bayati, 2020}. 

Performance measures:
I use a grouped figure to illustrate the robustness of our approach.
